# About
The methodology used to achieve the earlier stated objectives is explained below. The dataset collection consists of phishing and legitimate URLs
which were obtained from open-source platforms. The dataset was then pre-processed that is cleaned up from any abnormality such as missing data to avoid data
imbalance. Afterward, expository data analysis was done on the dataset to explore
and summarize the dataset. Once the dataset was free from all anomalies, website
content-based features were extracted from the dataset to get accurate features to
train and test the model. An extensive review was done on existing works of literature and machine learning models on detecting phishing websites to best decide the
classification models to solve the problem of detecting phishing websites.

Hence, Series of these machine learning classification models such as Decision
Tree, Support Vector Machine, XGBooster, Multilayer perceptions, Auto encoder
Neural Network and Random Forest was deployed on the dataset to distinguish between phishing and legitimate URLs. The best model with high training accuracy
out of all the deployed models was selected then integrated into a developed web
application. Thus, a user can enter a URL link on the web application to predict if it
is phishing or legitimate.
